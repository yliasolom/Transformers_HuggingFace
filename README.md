# Transformers_HuggingFace
Projects with Hugging Face library


### Introduction:
This repository contains three projects that focus on different aspects of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Each project is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook and utilizes various NLP techniques and frameworks.

`Code_generation.ipynb`
This notebook is dedicated to the task of code generation. It explores the generation of code snippets using deep learning techniques. The notebook provides an overview of the problem statement, data preprocessing steps, and the implementation of a code generation model. It also includes an evaluation of the model's performance and suggestions for future improvements.

`Question_answering.ipynb`
In this notebook, the task of question answering is tackled. The notebook presents a step-by-step approach to build a question-answering system using NLP and machine learning techniques. It covers the process of data preparation, training a question-answering model, and evaluating its performance. The notebook also includes a demo section that showcases the model's ability to answer user-defined questions.

`Summarization_(PyTorch).ipynb`
The focus of this notebook is on text summarization using the PyTorch framework. It provides an overview of different approaches to text summarization and demonstrates the implementation of an extractive text summarization model using the PyTorch library. The notebook covers data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation of the summarization model.

**Usage:**
To run the notebooks, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed along with the required dependencies. It is recommended to create a virtual environment and install the necessary packages using the provided requirements.txt file. Once the environment is set up, you can launch Jupyter Notebook and open the desired notebook file (.ipynb) to interact with the code.
